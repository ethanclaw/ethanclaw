I'm a Senior at Westlake High School in Austin, TX studying Computer Science and Programming. 

I currently work as an intern at Plato Team Inc, a gaming/chat startup, where I assist with research and marketing. 

I also work part time as an actor, and can be seen in spots for The SF Giants, the San Jose Sharks, Infosys, Autodesk, Toybox Labs, and more. 

I previously worked as a cashier and customer service rep at HEB. 

I'm an "A" student at Westlake High School, where I'm a Java programmer and robot designer on the Robotics team, and where I've received two academic honors: the Chemistry Academic Achievement Award, and the World History Academic Achievement Award. Both awards are given out to two students at the end of the year who show hard work, dedication, and academic excellence in the chosen subjects.
